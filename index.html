	<h1>Hi there, I'm GigaByteRex!</h1>
	<p>I'm a cybersecurity consultant specializing in penetration testing and incident response.<br>
	On this webpage I plan to put some stuff about me, and also blog about projects I do and other stuff I find interesting.<br>
    For now I guess this serves more as an information hub than anything else, but there's gonna be content here eventually&trade;.<br>
	If you want to reach out to me, I am available through the links at the bottom of the page! </p>
